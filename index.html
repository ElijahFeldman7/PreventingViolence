            <p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">Now that school is out, I spend most of my time on my passions like web development and personal research.</p>
            <p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">I also love to go to the pool, and every morning go to swim practice. I play with friends and swim competitively.</p>
            <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">Overall, I think I have a good balance. The time I need to be careful with is on the weekends when there is less structure. That's when poor decisions could be made, so I need to have a plan.</p>

            <p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">I've thought about what I would do if my friends wanted to get into a fight or do something violent. It's a scary thought, but I have a plan that makes me feel more in control.</p>

                    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> I will use one of my excuses, like needing to get home, to try and leave calmly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> If I can't leave easily, I will just send a text to my parents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> I will immediately go to a safe, public place if possible (like a well-lit store) and wait for my ride.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> I will tell my trusted adult what happened once I am safe.</li>
